# Python Tools & Infrastructure Project

This repository is a comprehensive suite of Python tools and services designed to streamline the development of scalable, production-grade systems. It provides modular solutions for data processing, communication, media management, scheduling, monitoring, database integration, and messaging systems.

## Key Features

### Database Management
- **MongoDB, SQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, S3**: Seamless integration with popular databases and storage solutions.
- **File Management**: Local and cloud-based file operations with metadata tracking.

### Communication Services
- **Kafka, RabbitMQ, WebSocket**: High-throughput messaging and real-time communication.
- **Event Bus**: In-memory event-driven architecture for decoupled systems.

### API & Web Services
- **FastAPI**: High-performance REST APIs with built-in documentation.
- **Authentication & Rate Limiting**: Secure and efficient API management.

### Data Processing
- **ETL Pipelines**: Data cleaning, transformation, and serialization.
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance monitoring and custom metric aggregation.

### Scheduling & Monitoring
- **Task Scheduler**: Cron-like job scheduling with distributed coordination.
- **Health Checks**: Real-time system monitoring and alerting.

### Media Processing
- **Audio Tools**: Transcription, translation, and audio file management.

### Utilities
- **Logging & Configuration**: Structured logging and dynamic configuration management.
- **Encryption & Validation**: Secure data handling and schema validation.

### Big Data Integration
- **Apache Spark**: Scalable data processing for large datasets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (for running external services)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Tools

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# Example commands to run modules
python databases/mongo_client.py
python api/api_server.py
python data_processing/job_runner.py
python scheduling_monitoring/health_check.py
```

## Design Philosophy
- **Modular Architecture**: Each component is self-contained and independently testable.
- **Scalability**: Designed for high-throughput and distributed systems.
- **Extensibility**: Clear interfaces for custom implementations.
- **Production-Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring.

## Infrastructure Requirements
Some modules depend on external services. Use the provided Docker Compose file to set up a local development environment:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Testing & Code Quality
- **Unit Tests**: Validate individual components.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure seamless interaction between modules.
- **Code Style**: Enforced with flake8, black, and mypy.
